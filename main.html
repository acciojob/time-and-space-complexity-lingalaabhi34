    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their
      <strong>Time Complexity</strong>. Time complexity refers to the amount of
      time an algorithm takes to complete in relation to the size of its input.
      In simpler terms, it helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is. An
      algorithm with better time complexity will execute faster, making it more
      desirable, especially for large inputs.

      Another important factor to evaluate is <strong>Space Complexity</strong>.
      Space complexity deals with the amount of memory or space an algorithm
      needs to run in relation to its input size. This is often expressed using
      the Big O notation, such as <strong>O(n)</strong>, where 'n' represents
      the input size. Optimizing space complexity is crucial in
      memory-constrained environments, as it ensures that an algorithm doesn't
      consume excessive memory resources.
