    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their
      Time Complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of
      time an algorithm takes to complete in relation to the size of its input.
      In simpler terms, it helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is. An
      algorithm with better time complexity will execute faster, making it more
      desirable, especially for large inputs.

      Another important factor to evaluate is <b>Space Complexity</b>.
    This is often expressed using the Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents
      the input size.
